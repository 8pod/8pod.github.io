Well, it is Friday the 13th, and while I would not consider myself an overly superstitious person, I have been known to avoid sticking my chopsticks into my rice bowl, scrambling to avoid stepping on the entrance threshold of any particular jinja I may be visiting, and partaking in various other Asian superstitions (I live in Japan.) I am going to throw caution to the wind, and published my new blog today regardless.

I have spent a couple of days now building out this site in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is touted as a true "hackers" endeavor. Two months ago, and some change, I had created a repository in my [GitHub](https://github.com/8pod) account to take advantage of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free offering from the fine folks @ GitHub. Initially I had planned on using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), but given its lack of apparent ongoing development, and my lack of experience with the underlying technology that Octopress extends, Jekyll, I opted to go with the later. 

Jekyll is fairly painless to get running. I wanted to validate my [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) preprocessing directives before submitting it to GitHub. This means I had to test it locally, and given Jekyll's Ruby origin, I had to install [Ruby and DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) on my Windows machine to perform that step - which took the longest time. This [Jekyll page](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) made that easy, but I spent too much time swapping out Ruby versions and troubleshooting things like this and this. 

I decided to start things out with a [theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/) rather then starting from starch, and I thought the [Type Theme](https://github.com/rohanchandra/type-theme) was nice. The developer of this theme had implemented Sass, and included a nice setup in [YAML front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) to allow references to various social media channels, and went to the effort of including a [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) reference. Nice.
